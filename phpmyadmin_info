To start it just run phpmyadmin-ctl install

If my Cloud9 username is "myUser" then I can change my password to "test" by running:

SET PASSWORD FOR 'myUser'@'%' = PASSWORD('test');

From this point, I'll get into the CLI for MySQL by doing:

mysql -u myUser -p

Then I'll be prompted for my password.
